                    <span id="subtitle">User Research</span><p id="ps">
               To get a better understanding of how the target audience interacts with digital media daily and how to better shape the content to benefit them, we conducted two focus groups of nearly a dozen people in each. One with people who self-identify as an individual with developmental disabilities, and the other with people who support an individual with developmental disabilities. We asked about what they usually do in their day, how the choices in their lives are made (if they require assistance or are independent in making their own decisions), their typical daily web use including the devices they use. Based on our findings, I was able to create personas to guide the product design and establish goals for this project that would benefit the user.</p></div>

developmental disabilities</p><p id="ps">

funds</p><p id="ps">
                    3. Tailor content to users based on age to allow for better and refined guidance</p><p id="ps">
                   4. Take a clean and modern design approach while keeping our target user in mind

                <span id="subtitle">Wireframes</span><p id="ps">
               After working with the team to create the sitemap, I moved on to begin developing some wireframes for the initial design of the website.  Once deciding on the functionality and where there was room to add to highlight the content more, the wireframes were brought to the visual design stage. </p></div>

                With the Project Manager, we planned, recruited and conducted testing for the final phase of the project. The intent was to have testing done during at least two stages of production but due to time constraints and other conflicts, user testing was only formally done after the prototype had been developed. However, throughout the project, there were focus groups who were able to validate elements of the design throughout the process. Our user testing sessions highlighted issues within the IA, website narrative and layout. The appropriate changes were made based on our findings. </p>

                     IF Library went into the visual design stage, was presented at Ontario Association on
Developmental Disabilities (OADD) Conference and is currently a living document that will be launched in October 2019.
